# Win2MacKeyMapping

This script maps a Danish Windows keyboard to Danish Mac keyboard via AutoHotkey (for use with NoMachine).
General mappings (e.g. cut/copy/paste) should work with any keyboard.
Special characters probably only works correctly for win DK to mac DK keyboard.
Key mappings are only active when NoMachine Mac Window is active.
Script has been testet and works with NoMachine v. 7.10.2.
This script will not be maintained and I provide no support.

The script works as intended only when "Grab the keyboard input" is NOT activated in NoMachine.

KeyMappings are divided into three sections:
Function mappings (copy/cut/paste etc.)
Character mappings (single characters)
X-Code shortcuts remapped (spepcific for X-code editor)

You may want to remove/outcomment X-code shortcuts remapped.
