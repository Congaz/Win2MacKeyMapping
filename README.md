# Win2MacKeyMapping

This script maps a Danish Windows keyboard to Mac via AutoHotkey (for use with NoMachine).
Script should work with any Windows keyboard, but has only been testet with a Win DK keyboard.
Key mappings are only active when NoMachine Mac Window is active.
This script will not be maintained and I provide no support.

The script works as intended only when "Grab the keyboard input" is NOT activated in NoMachine.

KeyMappings are divided into three sections:
Function mappings (copy/cut/paste etc.)
Character mappings (single characters)
X-Code shortcuts remapped (spepcific for X-code editor)

You may want to remove/outcomment X-code shortcuts remapped.
